To run the analysis, in the file "table_schemata.sql" do the following:
  Run code rows 1-45
  Adjust file paths to directory containing csv data which is to be imported into the database, rows 48-77.
  Finally run rows 80-86 to make necessary adjustments to tables, by assigning additional primary and foreign keys.
  
Once data has been imported, run the code blocks in the file "queries.sql" to return required information.

Refer to "ERD.png" for visual representation of table relationships.
